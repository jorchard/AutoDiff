# AutoDiff

Start with `optimization.ipynb`, a jupyter notebook that creates a function and finds its minimum using gradient descent. The gradients are computed using auto-differentiation (AD). This uses a small AD module that works for scalars only.

The notebook `Advanced_NN.ipynb` demonstrates how a 2D matrix version of AD is used in a neural network.
